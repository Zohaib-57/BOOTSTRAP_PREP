What is a Grid? 
In graphic design, a grid is a structure (usually two-dimensional) made up of a series of intersecting straight 
(vertical, horizontal) lines used to structure content. It is widely used to design layout and content structure in print 
design. In web design, it is a very effective method to create a consistent layout rapidly and effectively using HTML 
and CSS.
